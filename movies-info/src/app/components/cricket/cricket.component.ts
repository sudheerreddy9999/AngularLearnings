Besides, it will also be subject to the Indian team selection for the two-Test series against Bangladesh, but there is a possibility he could feature in the later stages of the six-match competition.

Bangladesh Cricket Board's newly elected president Faruque Ahmed announced that they are on the lookout for alternatives for Chandika Hathurusingha, the head coach, despite his contract running until the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.

His brilliant half-century in the first Test paved the way for the tourists to post a commendable total of 565.

So, it was very important that every single player believed that we can comeback any time,\" he said."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"\"After losing six wickets, as I mentioned before we still believed because he [Miraz] mentioned one thing before he went to bat: that he and Litton will do the job for the team and those guys [have led recoveries] before as well but this was impressive."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"\"And as I mentioned the belif they had and [was there in] the dressing room, it's been very, very different this time and I won't lie, we were really behind and we were a little bit nervous at that time but the way Miraz and Litton batted at that moment I think after 10/15 overs we were in a good position and we believed that these guys will take us to a good position,\" he said adding that he feels their bowling unit read the condition better than their opponent."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"Mehidy too echoed his captain's claim of self belief oozing through the camp and said his positive mindset provided dividends for him in difficult conditions. The 26-year-old was named player of the series for his all-round contributions in both games."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"In the opening Test, he rescued the tourists by hitting 77 runs and in the process forged a record 196-run stand with Mushfiqur Rahim for the eighth wicket to help Bangladesh earn a first innings lead. Later, he took four wickets with the ball in the second innings to set up the 10-wicket win."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"In the second Test, Mehidy claimed a five-wicket haul in the first innings to help them bowl out Pakistan for 274 and then put on 165 with centurion Litton after Bangladesh were reduced to 26 for 6."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"\"I was a little bit nervous at that time [at 26 for 6]. I just discussed with my partner and he just told me to keep quiet and play positively,\" Mehidy said. \"It's not on our hands, we lost six wickets you just try to get some good balls and try to get some runs on the scoreboard [and] definitely we can come back."}},{"content":{"contentType":"text","contentValue":"\"Actually, it's not an easy job [to play as an all-rounder] and I always try to play positively. It's been difficult to play on this surface. I just always, at all the time, think positive. I never think negatively, because if you think about negative things, then definitely you cannot perform well in these conditions.
